## NTWoC Project Details

### Abstract

Brevis (Latin word for short) News is a news summariser which can generate a summary of any news article (technically it will be able to generate a summary of any article but we'll model it to work better with news). This will be an open source competitor to Inshorts, news in 60 words.

### Skill Requirements (You can apply if you have any one of the skills mentioned below)
1) Python
2) NLP

### Things that we'll build

3) Fetching an article from a URL
